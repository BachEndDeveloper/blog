## Who am I?

Hi there!  
I'm Martin.  
Currently, I am finishing up my role as Lead Engineer, which I have recently resigned from.  
I've worked with a broad set of technologies over my career, but for the past 12+ years, I've mainly focused on C#.

I love what I do, and I hope to share my experiences and viewpoints with whoever reads this — maybe even future me.

I've been wanting to create a blog for the longest time. I hope to use this as an outlet and a way to focus on continuing to learn new things.

## What can you expect?

You can expect to read about everything related to software development and its surrounding areas.  
Although there are too many areas to mention, over the years, I've particularly immersed myself in code quality, system and cloud architecture, DevOps, and DevEx.  
Additionally, I'm a passionate keyboard enthusiast, so you might find a post or two about my keyboards!

First and foremost, I will try to incorporate this blog into my everyday challenges and share how I think about software development.

## What's to come

In the initial period, I'll take you along with me as I embark on a new job:
- How I approach starting a new job.
- How I tackle the challenges I encounter.
- Why I chose the job.
- How I integrate into a new work environment.
- Engaging with new colleagues.
- The mental aspects of starting a new job.

I hope this will be enjoyable, and at the very least, I believe it will be helpful to myself—a way for me to organize my thoughts.

As I mentioned, I've been wanting to start a blog for a long time, and I already have some blog posts written in hard copies, along with some code.

The upcoming topics will include:
- DevEx: Automating your local development environment.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
  - Terraform
  - Bicep
  - Pulumi

I don't know when the blog posts will be out. First, I will try to bring you along with me as I start my new job.
