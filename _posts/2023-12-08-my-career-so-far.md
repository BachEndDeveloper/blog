## Starting Out:
Back in 2012, fresh out of school after arming myself with a degree in Computer Science, I delved into the professional world.  
Over time, I have done what I can to go back to school for more courses a mix of Computer Science (TDD, Architecture, Cloud development), Management, and a few certifications.  
I do miss going to schoole some day - even though I didn't appreciate it at the time :)

## GolfBox:
My debut gig was at GolfBox, a small company with 22 people, 15 of whom were fellow code wranglers.  
We created software to assist golf clubs with their course and member management.  
In the beginning I was using classic ASP, PHP, and SQL.  
At some point I was put on a project integrating with credit card terminals, where I used C# and a dash of C++.

Technologies: Classic ASP, PHP, C#, C++, SQL

## Consulent at Bording Data:
A recruiter contacted me and I got into consulting at Bording Data.  
I worked APIs, applications, and integrating with an old mainframe ERP system.  
Everything I did was written C# and .Net Framework (there were some older Silverlight applications as well.... ).  
Legacy software issues? Oh, they're like the universal language of tech - a constant, no matter where you go.

Technologies: C#, WPF, Silverlight, 

## Manager/Tech Lead at Jyske Finans:
Jyske Finans was a game-changer.  
Starting as a Software Engineer, I leveled up to Senior Engineer, and later I got promoted to Manager/Tech Lead.   
DevOps, architecture, compliance, day-to-day work and support – we had a very broad spectrum of work. We even managed some of our own servers on-premise.  
We implemented a cloud strategy and setup the first cloud environments, focused on getting the team into a DevOps mindset.
By the time I left the IT department was it a strong position, have automated deployment throughout on-premise applications and to our cloud environments.  
I am still very very proud of what I helped achieve at Jyske Finans.  
A big reason for why I got to have such an impact was some really close and supportive colleages and my amazing Director.

Technologies: Azure DevOps, Octopus Deploy, GitHub, GitHub Actions, Bicep, ARM, .Net (.Net Framework and .Net 6), C#, EF Core, Powershell, Bash, Java, Angular, Typescript, SQL.

## Lead Developer at Aiia (December 2022):
Fast forward to December 2022 – I joined Aiia, a Mastercard subsidiary.
Spiir is a personal finance management app that is completly Cloud-native.  
The culture is very startup and youthful. I all of a sudden became the "old guy" at work.  
It has been quite the culture change for me.

You should look up the Spiir app - it's a great tool for getting an overview of your personal finances: [Spiir](https://spiir.com)

Technologies: Azure DevOps, C#, Angular, Powershell, Terraform.

## Retrospective:
After a year at Aiia – clearer goals has emerged: becoming a people-lead while holding on to my tech nerdiness.  
No "I used to be programmer" for me – I aim for the sweet spot between managing and nerding out.  
I really want to bring more deep technical skill into management, because I see it as a area that's lacking.

## Next Stop – Cloud Solution Architect:
By a happy accident I came across a jobposting:
Cloud Solution Architect and Thought Leader, with some people management.  
It felt like the next logical level in this epic game of tech and career evolution.

I will write must more about my new job in a later post. 

For now I hope you got some insights into what I've been upto the past 12 years.
