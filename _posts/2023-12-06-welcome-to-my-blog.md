## Who am I
Hi!
I'm Martin
Currently I am finising up my current job as Lead Enginner, that I have just resigned from.
I've worked in a broad set of technologies, but for the past 12+ year, I've been working mostely with C#.

I love what I do - and I hope to share my experiences and my points of view with whomever reads this.
(Maybe future me... )

I've been wanting to create a blog for the longest time.
I hope to use this as an outlet and a way of focusing myself on continue to learn new things.

## What can you expect?
You can expect to read about everything software development and the surrounding areas.
By now all the areas are too many to mention, but over the year especially code quality, 
system- and clound architecture and DevOps and DevEx - all have been taking up more 
and more of my time. 
Besides that - I am a pretty vivid keyboard enthusiast, so maybe I'll write a post or two about my keyboards!

First and foremost I will try and include this blog into my everyday challenges and how I think 
about software development. 

## What to come
For the first while I will try and take this blog along with me, as I start a new job.
- How I think about starting a new job.
- How I go about solving the challenges I face.
- Why I took the job.
- How I try to fit into a new work environment.
- Engaging with new colleagues.
- The mental aspect of starting a new job.

I hope this will be fun and atleast I belive it will be helpful to myself.
A way for me to get my thoughts inline.

As I said, I've been wanting to do a blog for a long time, and I already have some blogposts
written in hardcopies, along with some code.

The topics will be
- DevEx, automating you local development environment
- IaC
  - Terraform
  - Bicep
  - Pulumi

I don't know when the blogposts will be out.
First I will try to bring you along with me,
as I start my new job.
