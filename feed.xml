I want to use this post as a quick run through of my career so far.<br />
What I’ve done and where I’m going.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="starting-out">Starting Out:</h2>
<p>Back in 2012, fresh out of school after arming myself with a degree in Computer Science, I delved into the professional world.<br />
Over time, I have done what I can to go back to school for more courses a mix of Computer Science (TDD, Architecture, Cloud development), Management, and a few certifications.<br />
I do miss going to schoole some day - even though I didn’t appreciate it at the time :)</p>

<h2 id="golfbox">GolfBox:</h2>
<p>My debut gig was at GolfBox, a small company with 22 people, 15 of whom were fellow code wranglers.<br />
We created software to assist golf clubs with their course and member management.<br />
In the beginning I was using classic ASP, PHP, and SQL.<br />
At some point I was put on a project integrating with credit card terminals, where I used C# and a dash of C++.</p>

<p>Technologies: Classic ASP, PHP, C#, C++, SQL</p>

<h2 id="consulent-at-bording-data">Consulent at Bording Data:</h2>
<p>A recruiter contacted me and I got into consulting at Bording Data.<br />
I worked on APIs, web- and client-applications, and integrating with an old mainframe ERP system.<br />
Everything I did was written C# and .Net Framework (there were some older Silverlight applications as well…. ).<br />
Legacy software issues? Oh, they’re like the universal language of tech - a constant, no matter where you go.</p>

<p>Technologies: C#, WPF, Silverlight,</p>

<h2 id="managertech-lead-at-jyske-finans">Manager/Tech Lead at Jyske Finans:</h2>
<p>Jyske Finans was a game-changer.<br />
Starting as a Software Engineer, I leveled up to Senior Engineer, and later I got promoted to Manager/Tech Lead. <br />
DevOps, architecture, compliance, day-to-day work and support – we had a very broad spectrum of work. We even managed some of our own servers on-premise.<br />
We implemented a cloud strategy and setup the first cloud environments, focused on getting the team into a DevOps mindset.
By the time I left the IT department was it a strong position, have automated deployment throughout on-premise applications and to our cloud environments.<br />
I am still very very proud of what I helped achieve at Jyske Finans.<br />
A big reason for why I got to have such an impact was some really close and supportive colleages and my amazing Director.</p>

<p>Technologies: Azure DevOps, Octopus Deploy, GitHub, GitHub Actions, Bicep, ARM, .Net (.Net Framework and .Net 6), C#, EF Core, Powershell, Bash, Java, Angular, Typescript, SQL.</p>

<h2 id="lead-developer-at-aiia-december-2022">Lead Developer at Aiia (December 2022):</h2>
<p>Fast forward to December 2022 – I joined Aiia, a Mastercard subsidiary.
Spiir is a personal finance management app that is completly Cloud-native.<br />
The culture is very startup and youthful. I all of a sudden became the “old guy” at work.<br />
It has been quite the culture change for me.</p>

<p>You should look up the Spiir app - it’s a great tool for getting an overview of your personal finances: <a href="https://spiir.com">Spiir</a></p>

<p>Technologies: Azure DevOps, C#, Angular, Powershell, Terraform.</p>

<h2 id="retrospective">Retrospective:</h2>
<p>After a year at Aiia – clearer goals has emerged: becoming a people-lead while holding on to my tech nerdiness.<br />
No “I used to be programmer” for me – I aim for the sweet spot between managing and nerding out.<br />
I really want to bring more deep technical skill into management, because I see it as a area that’s lacking.</p>

<h2 id="next-stop--cloud-solution-architect">Next Stop – Cloud Solution Architect:</h2>
<p>By a happy accident I came across a jobposting:
Cloud Solution Architect and Thought Leader, with some people management.<br />
It felt like the next logical level in this epic game of tech and career evolution.</p>

<p>I will write must more about my new job in a later post.</p>

<p>For now I hope you got some insights into what I’ve been upto the past 12 years.</p>

<p>Hi there!<br />
I’m Martin.<br />
Currently, I am finishing up my role as Lead Engineer, which I have recently resigned from.<br />
I’ve worked with a broad set of technologies over my career, but for the past 12+ years, I’ve mainly focused on C#.</p>

<p>I love what I do, and I hope to share my experiences and viewpoints with whoever reads this — maybe even future me.</p>

<p>I’ve been wanting to create a blog for the longest time. I hope to use this as an outlet and a way to focus on continuing to learn new things.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-you-expect">What can you expect?</h2>

<p>You can expect to read about everything related to software development and its surrounding areas.<br />
Although there are too many areas to mention, over the years, I’ve particularly immersed myself in code quality, system and cloud architecture, DevOps, and DevEx.<br />
Additionally, I’m a passionate keyboard enthusiast, so you might find a post or two about my keyboards!</p>

<p>First and foremost, I will try to incorporate this blog into my everyday challenges and share how I think about software development.</p>

<h2 id="whats-to-come">What’s to come</h2>

<p>In the initial period, I’ll take you along with me as I embark on a new job:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How I approach starting a new job.</li>
  <li>How I tackle the challenges I encounter.</li>
  <li>Why I chose the job.</li>
  <li>How I integrate into a new work environment.</li>
  <li>Engaging with new colleagues.</li>
  <li>The mental aspects of starting a new job.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope this will be enjoyable, and at the very least, I believe it will be helpful to myself—a way for me to organize my thoughts.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, I’ve been wanting to start a blog for a long time, and I already have some blog posts written in hard copies, along with some code.</p>

<p>The upcoming topics will include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>DevEx: Automating your local development environment.</li>
  <li>Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
    <ul>
      <li>Terraform</li>
      <li>Bicep</li>
      <li>Pulumi</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t know when the blog posts will be out. First, I will try to bring you along with me as I start my new job.</p>
